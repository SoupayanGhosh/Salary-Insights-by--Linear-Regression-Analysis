# üíº Salary Insights: Linear Regression Analysis

Welcome to the **Salary Insights Linear Regression Analysis** project! This repository demonstrates how to use linear regression to uncover the relationship between years of experience and salary, providing actionable insights for HR analytics, career planning, and data science learning.

## üìä Project Overview
This project explores a classic regression problem: **Can we predict an employee's salary based on their years of experience?** Using Python and popular data science libraries, we:
- Visualize the data
- Quantify relationships
- Build and evaluate a predictive model
- Present results with clear, professional plots

## üìÇ Dataset Information

- **Dataset Name:** Salary_Data.csv
- **Source:** This is a widely used, synthetic dataset for regression analysis, often found in data science tutorials and machine learning courses. It simulates real-world salary data for demonstration and educational purposes.
- **Description:**
  - The dataset contains 30 records, each representing an individual's years of professional experience and their corresponding annual salary in USD.
  - It is designed to illustrate a strong linear relationship between experience and salary, making it ideal for linear regression modeling.
- **Variables:**
  - `YearsExperience` (float): Number of years of professional experience (ranging from 1.1 to 10.5 years)
  - `Salary` (float): Annual salary in US dollars (ranging from $39,343 to $122,391)
- **Missing Values:**
  - There is one missing value in the `Salary` column, which is handled by removing the corresponding row during preprocessing.
- **Sample Rows:**
  | YearsExperience | Salary  |
  |----------------|---------|
  | 1.1            | 39343   |
  | 2.0            | 43525   |
  | 3.2            | 64445   |
  | 7.9            | 101302  |
  | 10.5           | 121872  |

## üßë‚Äçüíª Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Remove missing values
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:**
   - Scatterplots to visualize trends
   - Correlation heatmaps to quantify relationships
3. **Modeling:**
   - Train/test split (70/30)
   - Linear Regression using scikit-learn
   - Model evaluation (R¬≤, MSE)
4. **Visualization:**
   - Actual vs. predicted salaries
   - Regression line overlay

## üìà Key Results & Visualizations
- **Strong positive correlation** between experience and salary (correlation ‚âà 0.98)
- The regression model fits the data well, with predictions closely matching actual salaries
- Visualizations include:
  - Scatterplot of data
  - Correlation heatmap
  - Regression line with predictions
